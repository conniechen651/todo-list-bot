# To-Do List discord bot
This is a simple bot that keeps a list of all your tasks and to-dos.

It has three slash commands: add-task to add a task and due date to the to-do list, remove-task to remove a finished task from the list, and show-list to display all the tasks and due dates.

This list was implemented using a linked list for easy insertion and deletion with nodes that contain both the task and due date.

A future improvement to include would be to have the bot alert the user when a task's due date is coming up.
